pearson correlation coefficient 

range (-1 to 1) 
-1  = strong negative 
1- strong possitive
0- no correlation


roc graph - hme confusion matrix bahut saari bnani pdti h esse bchne ke lye hum roc graph bnate h 
roc graph provides simple way to summarise all of the information.. its a probability curve .
jtna roc curve near hota h 1 ke utna hi roc apne model ko aur best consider krta h .
ITS A GRAPH DRAWN BETWEEN true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. 
TRUE POSSITIVE= TP/(TP+FN)                     FALSE POSSITIVE= FP/(FP+TN) i.e 1-SPEIFICITY

Hum aase hi threshold incr. kr krke points nikalte jaenge  . then roc graph swill summarise all the confusion matrix that each threshold produced .
